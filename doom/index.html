			<h1>doom</h1>
			<p>i am very good at doom and i will use this page to talk about all the things ive done in it. I have a goal to deathless (or at least mostly deathless) every single doom game ever </p>
			<h2>The Ultimate Doom</h2>
			<p>this is actually the first doom game i played and i started it in december of 2022. I play with classic controls on ultraviolence and i really dont like strafing. I have used the splitting of sections into episodes as "checkpoints" I must deathless each episode. I have currently completed episodes 1-3 and am working on 4. I have sunk at least 100 attempts into it so far with over half of them dying in mission 1 and most of the rest dying on M2 and ive only had 2 make it to M6</p>
